📘 Introduction to TypeScript (TS)

🔹 What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.
It is a superset of JavaScript, which means: 
✅ Any JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code.
TypeScript adds extra features on top of JavaScript—the most important one is types.

🔹 Why Do We Need TypeScript?

JavaScript is powerful, but it has a big problem:
👉 Errors appear only when the program is running.

TypeScript fixes this by:
1. Finding mistakes before running the program
2. Making code more predictable and safer
3. Helping developers write clean and maintainable code

📌 In short:
TypeScript helps us catch errors early and write better code.

🔹 What Problem Does TypeScript Solve?

In JavaScript:
let age = 20;
age = "twenty"; // No error 😕

This can cause bugs later.

In TypeScript:
let age: number = 20;
age = "twenty"; // ❌ Error (caught early)

✅ Error is caught while coding itself.

🔹 Key Features of TypeScript:

1. Static typing (define data types)
2. Early error detection
3. Better code readability
4. Strong IDE support (auto-suggestions, warnings)
5. Easy to manage large projects

🔹 Where Is TypeScript Helpful?

TypeScript is especially useful in:
1️⃣ Large Applications
Many files & developers
Types prevent confusion and mistakes

2️⃣ Web Development
React + TypeScript
Angular (built using TS)
Safer frontend code

3️⃣ Backend Development
Node.js with TypeScript
Clean APIs and server-side logic

4️⃣ Team Projects
Clear contracts between code parts
Easy collaboration

🔹 Does Browser Understand TypeScript?
❌ No, browsers only understand JavaScript.

So:
TypeScript → Compiled → JavaScript → Browser

TypeScript is converted to JavaScript using a compiler called tsc.
